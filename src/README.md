GrubDash Backend and API
GrubDash is a fictional company that operates an online food ordering and food delivery platform.

For this Thinkful project, I set up a RESTful API, wrote custom validation functions, created route handlers, and built specific API endpoints. Of note, the front-end application was provided for this assignment.

Languages, frameworks, and packages used include:

JavaScript
Node.js
Express
CORS (Node package for Express)
